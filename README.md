# Disklavier-Echo-Effect

Project as part of MUS 305 at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, under the course direction of Dr. Heinrich Taube

- This project aims to simulate an "echo" effect on a Yamaha Disklavier piano, on up to 16 key simulatenously, with repetitions and diminishing of echo sound up to the performer.
- The program runs using the musx library and uses threading to run real-time outputs to a Yamaha Disklavier.
